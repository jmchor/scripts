# ðŸ’€ useful scripts for all kinds of "automation"

## Scripts are fun and easy to make - so why not make some scripts?

### Uses

- scripts can be used to bundle commands on your local machine. You could use aliases, but a shell script is just easier
- initialize projects in a matter of seconds and with one line of code!

### scripts

 so far, I have created one script for a very specific purpose:

#### Setting up a TypeScript project

 To be even more specific, the project includes:

- an .eslintrc configuration
- a .prettierrc configuration
- the wesbos/eslint configuration
- various DevDependencies, which will be installed using pnpm
- TypeScript, tsup, and so on and so on

Feel free to modify the script, since right now it is custom-made for me!
